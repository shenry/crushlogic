Crushlogic, (c) 2008 by Stuart Henry
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crushlogic is an online harvest (winemaking) tool for wine fermentation tracking and management. Goals of this software are:

	+ Record lots and lot attributes (crush date, tons, tank, blend no., etc)
	+ Enter brix and temps (kinetics) against lots, either one-at-a-time or through a global form
	+ Enter pumpover/punchdown against lots, either one-at-a-time or through a global form
	+ Enter crush analysis, periodic daily analysis and press analysis
	+ Create additions to lots based on analysis and desired addition rate
	+ Record tanks as being pressed
	+ Generate fermentation reports
	
This is a work in progress and is not currently a functioning app... at this point I am still defining the UI and creating html mockups.
